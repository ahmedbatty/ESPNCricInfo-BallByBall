 There's a wrap of that innings. And it was a slug fest of massive 
proportions. Late wickets have hurt their race towards what at one point
 looked like a 200 total. But they will be mighty pleased with this. 
Karachi Kings wanted a target in front of them, and they have one. They 
need to come out swinging from ball one and play the game of their lives
 to chase this down. Kamran Akmal continues to bat like a dream. When he
 has days like today, there are few more tantalising hitters in cricket.
 Mohammad Amir's genius shone through in a high-scoring boundary 
barrage, as he went at four an over in a stellar spell. Now he needs his
 batsmen to deliver. Be back shortly with the chase.</p><div class="item-wrapper"><div class="over"><div class="time-stamp">15.6</div><div class="over-circle low-score"><span class="over-score">1b</span></div></div><div class="description">Mills

 what's with this late rush of wickets? It's hurting their finish. Wahab
 gets a shortish one that has its pace pulled back. Musters all the 
power he can but his slap only carries as far as long-on running to his 
right for a simple catch</div></div><p class="dismissal">Wahab Riaz c Denly b Mills 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00</p></div><div class="commentary-item  "><div class="item-wrapper"><div class="over"><div class="time-stamp">15.4</div><div class="over-circle wicket"><span class="over-score">W</span></div></div><div class="description">Mills to Saad Nasim, <b>OUT</b>,
 complete miscommunication, results in a wasted wicket. Saad Nasim ends 
up sacrificing his wicket. He simply stayed at the crease and swung at 
one angling away from him. Missed and the ball went straight to the 
keeper. But Wahab was eager to steal a bye and ended up at the striker's

 Alright then, we're set for the start. Peshawar Zalmi, under the 
ever-popular Darren Sammy, are the defending champions, and are eyeing 
another memorable night in Karachi. At the other end are the team based 
out of the venue of the final, the Karachi Kings, who are looking at a 
memorable home final. More often than not, it's advantage to the team 
batting second under these sort of conditions. But, whatever, Peshawar

 how peaceful and lawful Pakistan has been is hosting whatever little it
 has gotten a chance to host. This should be kept in consideration from

and following it on phone. Wish I was commentating in place of Sreshth, 
who has made it a habit of calling thrilling games. I'm hoping for one 
tonight though, even if it strains the heart a little.</p><p class="comment">
What a cracking game we had last night. Every rupee paid for tickets 
worth it's weight in gold. A heart-stopping last-ball thriller that gave
 Peshawar Zalmi a new lease of life after they appeared to have all but 
sealed it much before it got to that final over. Now, less than 24 hours
 later, they'll have to be totally switched on again. In their way are 
the Karachi Kings, who were blown away by Islamabad United three nights 
ago. </p><p class="comment">
<b>5.30pm </b> A chopper was summoned a short while ago to dry the 
outfield. All the covers are off. Lights starting to take effect. The 
rains have brought the temperatures down.</p><p class="comment">
<b>5.26pm </b> Hello everyone. Huge rain clouds hover over Lahore. It 
poured and poured this morning, leaving huge puddles in the outfield. 
But my colleague Danyal Rasool, who has just cleared the security cordon
 and entered the venue, tells me the drainage system is "pretty good." 
Things looking much, much better now than it did a few hours ago. If 
there's no more rain, we could even be looking at an on-time start. If 
not, the delay shouldn't be too big. Fingers crossed.</p><p class="comment"></p><p class="comment"><b>2.20 pm</b>
 Just in: Shahid Afridi and Imad Wasim will not play for Karachi Kings 
today - both injured - and Eoin Morgan did not travel to Lahore. So 
Karachi Kings will be led by Mohammad Amir in the second Eliminator 
against Peshawar Zalmi. At stake - a spot in the PSL final.</p></div><span style="display: none;"></span></div></article><div id="banner" class="react-ad react-ad ad-banner-mobile ad-wrapper ad-slot" data-slot-type="banner"

Hope you enjoyed our coverage. Hope to see you for the grand finale. Until then, this is Shashank Kishore and Akshay Gopalakrishnan saying goodbye.\n\n&lt;b&gt;11.30pm &lt;/b&gt; No home final for Karachi. Instead, Peshawar Zalmi will have an opportunity to defend their crown on Sunday at the National Stadium. The difference between both sides tonight: Kamran Akmal. Much-maligned in these parts of the world, but the impact he&#39;s had on Zalmi can&#39;t be understated.\n\nPeshawar Zalmi had to win four games on a trot at one stage to get to the final and they did. Daren Sammy has literally hobbled on one leg for a better part of the last four days to lead them into the final. Can they cap off with the ultimate crowning glory on Sunday?\n\n&lt;b&gt; Time for the presentation: &lt;/b&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt; Kamran Akmal &lt;/b&gt;, who smashed a 27-ball 77, PSL&#39;s fastest half-century, proved to be the X factor on the night. No surprises than that he&#39;s &lt;b&gt; Player of the Match &lt;/b&gt; too. He started the tournament poorly, made three ducks along the way but boy, didn&#39;t he rev up when it mattered most? He receives the &lt;b&gt; Hanif Mohammed cap &lt;/b&gt; from Younis Khan for being the &lt;b&gt; highest run-getter &lt;/b&gt; in the tournament at the moment.\n\n&lt;b&gt; Peshawar Zalmi captain Daren Sammy: &lt;/b&gt; Akmal&#39;s partnership with Fletchee was exceptional. The guys have shown good character. The strength of this team is all of us stick together. Coming here, the support we had from the fans was amazing. Two exciting games, we couldn&#39;t have asked for more.\n\n&lt;b&gt; Karachi Kings&#39; stand-in captain Mohammad Amir: &lt;/B&gt; Today was Kamran Akmal&#39;s day. Whatever he hit connected today. It would&#39;ve been fun to play the final in Karachi. For now, we&#39;ll have to learn from our mistakes.\n\n\nKapil: &quot;Hindsight is beautiful but Azam&#39;s innings actually lost Karachi the game. He starts off ridiculously slowly and keeping Ingram in hut and sending Azam was the poorest decision by Arthur. Remember they were chasing 171 in 16, not 20 overs. And in PP, overs 2-4, they scored only 12 runs&quot;\n\nfaisal : &quot;Champion Vs Champion, Ronchi Vs Kamran, Sami Vs Wahab, Sammy Vs Misbah The Most Suited Final For PSL2018 &quot;\n\nHamza: &quot;What a final there is going to be it will also be the contest between Kamran vs Ronchi for top scorer and Faheem vs Wahab for leading wickets.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nVisakh: &quot;Completely agree with Kapil. Babar faced nearly half of the 96 balls and got 63 runs.. other batsmen needed to get 107 runs off the other half balls left.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;b&gt; Hasan Ali on Zalmi&#39;s qualification: &lt;/b&gt; I returned to play after a month, it seems like I&#39;ve found my rhythm back. Today, the way Kamran Akmal played, no praise is enough for him. He&#39;s been batting well all tournament. Third PSL in a row that he&#39;s contributed.\n\nSoham Sarkhel says: &quot;Having wickets in hand very much overrated in T20s. Karachi Kings failed to match up to the pace. A batsman has to keep taking the occasional risks, resources not fully utilised otherwise.&quot;","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":15.5,"text":"Wahab Riaz to Denly, 1 run, pulls this short ball on middle to deep square. &lt;b&gt; Game over. &lt;/b&gt; Karachi&#39;s hopes extinguished.","event":1,"commId":"24536801","commSeq":201506,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":15.4,"text":"Wahab Riaz to Denly, <b>FOUR</b>, slapped over cover, good strike, clean strike.

Instead, Peshawar Zalmi will have an opportunity to defend their crown on Sunday at the National Stadium. The difference between both sides tonight: Kamran Akmal. Much-maligned in these parts of the world, but the impact he&#39;s had on Zalmi can&#39;t be understated.\n\nPeshawar Zalmi had to win four games on a trot at one stage to get to the final and they did. Daren Sammy has literally hobbled on one leg for a better part of the last four days to lead them into the final. Can they cap off with the ultimate crowning glory on Sunday?\n\n&lt;b&gt; Time for the presentation: &lt;/b&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt; Kamran Akmal &lt;/b&gt;, who smashed a 27-ball 77, PSL&#39;s fastest half-century, proved to be the X factor on the night. No surprises than that he&#39;s &lt;b&gt; Player of the Match &lt;/b&gt; too. He started the tournament poorly, made three ducks along the way but boy, didn&#39;t he rev up when it mattered most? He receives the &lt;b&gt; Hanif Mohammed cap &lt;/b&gt; from Younis Khan for being the &lt;b&gt; highest run-getter &lt;/b&gt; in the tournament at the moment.\n\n&lt;b&gt; Peshawar Zalmi captain Daren Sammy: &lt;/b&gt; Akmal&#39;s partnership with Fletchee was exceptional. The guys have shown good character. The strength of this team is all of us stick together. Coming here, the support we had from the fans was amazing. Two exciting games, we couldn&#39;t have asked for more.\n\n&lt;b&gt; Karachi Kings&#39; stand-in captain Mohammad Amir: &lt;/B&gt; Today was Kamran Akmal&#39;s day. Whatever he hit connected today. It would&#39;ve been fun to play the final in Karachi. For now, we&#39;ll have to learn from our mistakes.\n\n\nKapil: &quot;Hindsight is beautiful but Azam&#39;s innings actually lost Karachi the game. He starts off ridiculously slowly and keeping Ingram in hut and sending Azam was the poorest decision by Arthur. Remember they were chasing 171 in 16, not 20 overs. And in PP, overs 2-4, they scored only 12 runs&quot;\n\nfaisal : &quot;Champion Vs Champion, Ronchi Vs Kamran, Sami Vs Wahab, Sammy Vs Misbah The Most Suited Final For PSL2018 &quot;\n\nHamza: &quot;What a final there is going to be it will also be the contest between Kamran vs Ronchi for top scorer and Faheem vs Wahab for leading wickets.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nVisakh: &quot;Completely agree with Kapil. Babar faced nearly half of the 96 balls and got 63 runs.. other batsmen needed to get 107 runs off the other half balls left.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;b&gt; Hasan Ali on Zalmi&#39;s qualification: &lt;/b&gt; I returned to play after a month, it seems like I&#39;ve found my rhythm back. Today, the way Kamran Akmal played, no praise is enough for him. He&#39;s been batting well all tournament. Third PSL in a row that he&#39;s contributed.\n\nSoham Sarkhel says: &quot;Having wickets in hand very much overrated in T20s. Karachi Kings failed to match up to the pace.

Daren Sammy has literally hobbled on one leg for a better part of the last four days to lead them into the final. Can they cap off with the ultimate crowning glory on Sunday?\n\n&lt;b&gt; Time for the presentation: &lt;/b&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt; Kamran Akmal &lt;/b&gt;, who smashed a 27-ball 77, PSL&#39;s fastest half-century, proved to be the X factor on the night. No surprises than that he&#39;s &lt;b&gt; Player of the Match &lt;/b&gt; too. He started the tournament poorly, made three ducks along the way but boy, didn&#39;t he rev up when it mattered most? He receives the &lt;b&gt; Hanif Mohammed cap &lt;/b&gt; from Younis Khan for being the &lt;b&gt; highest run-getter &lt;/b&gt; in the tournament at the moment.\n\n&lt;b&gt; Peshawar Zalmi captain Daren Sammy: &lt;/b&gt; Akmal&#39;s partnership with Fletchee was exceptional. The guys have shown good character. The strength of this team is all of us stick together. Coming here, the support we had from the fans was amazing. Two exciting games, we couldn&#39;t have asked for more.\n\n&lt;b&gt; Karachi Kings&#39; stand-in captain Mohammad Amir: &lt;/B&gt; Today was Kamran Akmal&#39;s day. Whatever he hit connected today. It would&#39;ve been fun to play the final in Karachi. For now, we&#39;ll have to learn from our mistakes.\n\n\nKapil: &quot;Hindsight is beautiful but Azam&#39;s innings actually lost Karachi the game. He starts off ridiculously slowly and keeping Ingram in hut and sending Azam was the poorest decision by Arthur. Remember they were chasing 171 in 16, not 20 overs. And in PP, overs 2-4, they scored only 12 runs&quot;\n\nfaisal : &quot;Champion Vs Champion, Ronchi Vs Kamran, Sami Vs Wahab, Sammy Vs Misbah The Most Suited Final For PSL2018 &quot;\n\nHamza: &quot;What a final there is going to be it will also be the contest between Kamran vs Ronchi for top scorer and Faheem vs Wahab for leading wickets.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nVisakh: &quot;Completely agree with Kapil. Babar faced nearly half of the 96 balls and got 63 runs.. other batsmen needed to get 107 runs off the other half balls left.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;b&gt; Hasan Ali on Zalmi&#39;s qualification: &lt;/b&gt; I returned to play after a month, it seems like I&#39;ve found my rhythm back. Today, the way Kamran Akmal played, no praise is enough for him. He&#39;s been batting well all tournament. Third PSL in a row that he&#39;s contributed.\n\nSoham Sarkhel says: &quot;Having wickets in hand very much overrated in T20s. Karachi Kings failed to match up to the pace. A batsman has to keep taking the occasional risks, resources not fully utilised otherwise.&quot;","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":15.5,"text":"Wahab Riaz to Denly, 1 run, pulls this short ball on middle to deep square. &lt;b&gt; Game over. &lt;/b&gt; Karachi&#39;s hopes extinguished.","event":1,"commId":"24536801","commSeq":201506,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":15.4,"text":"Wahab Riaz to Denly, <b>FOUR</b>, slapped over cover, good strike, clean strike.

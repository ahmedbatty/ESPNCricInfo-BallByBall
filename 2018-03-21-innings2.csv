the bat as he too brings up a half-century"

 Asif to Babar Azam, 1 run, drills this square drive to point and

3.5,0,"Sameen Gul to Denly, no run,  dropped by Gul off his own bowling

boundary in the world."

1.2,W,"Sameen Gul to Mukhtar Ahmed, OUT,
 thick outside edge and this is a sensational catch by Sammy at first 
slip. Mukhtar's first outing in PSL is a very brief one. He looked to

 work"
